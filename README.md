# greedy-and-dynamic-programming-
this is a repository containing the problmes in c++ on greedy and dynamic programming in c++
I have exaplained the code as well as the methods in both the cases

There are two types of programming which are greedy and dynamic ,there some differnece between the both.
Greedy makes the best choice at each step with the hope of finding the optiaml solution.Although it doesnt always give the perfect solution , it still is an efficent way as it utilises less time and is faster to implement
